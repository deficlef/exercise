# Project Title

Domin technical exercise.

## Description

A simple web application with a dashboard showing the top 10 countries in the world with the most borders, and countries sharing borders with China.
Also includes a button to generate PDF of dashboard.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

#### Online access
* The web application is available on https://domin-exercise.herokuapp.com/

#### Locally

* On a command line, navigate to project directory
```
cd <PROJECT_DIR>
```
* Run with Gradle
```
./gradlew bootRun
```
By default the application should now be running on http://localhost:8080. If this is not the case, look through the Gradle log  
for the port where Tomcat was initialized and replace 8080.
